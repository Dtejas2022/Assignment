# Item Filter App

This is a React-based Item Filter application that allows users to filter a list of items through a search bar. The app uses Redux for state management and WebSockets for real-time updates. This README contains instructions on how to set up and run the project, as well as additional information about the implementation.

## Features

- **Item Filtering:** Users can filter a list of items (e.g., fruits) by typing in a search bar.
- **Real-Time Updates:** The item list can be updated in real-time if connected to a WebSocket server.
- **State Management:** Redux is used to manage the state of the item list and search query.
- **Responsive UI:** The UI is simple and responsive for different screen sizes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v12 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/item-filter-app.git
   cd item-filter-app
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Or using Yarn
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the React Development Server

To start the React application, run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# Or using Yarn
yarn start
```

This will start the development server and automatically open the app in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 2. (Optional) Start WebSocket Server

If your app uses WebSockets for real-time updates, make sure the WebSocket server is running. Refer to the WebSocket server setup in your project, if applicable.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **Redux Toolkit:** Simplifies Redux logic with less boilerplate.
- **WebSockets:** For real-time communication (if enabled).
- **CSS/SCSS:** For styling components.

## Additional Notes

### State Management with Redux
The application uses Redux to manage the global state for the list of items and the search query. The `itemsSlice.js` file contains the logic to set and filter items.

### Item Filtering
The `SearchBar` component dispatches a Redux action that updates the search query, which in turn filters the displayed items in the `ItemList` component.

### WebSocket Connection (Optional)
If you're using WebSockets for real-time updates, ensure that the WebSocket server is correctly configured. You can adjust the WebSocket endpoint in `WebSocketClient.js`.

### Environment Variables
You can add custom environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project. For example:

```env
REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:3000
```

### Deployment
For deploying the app, consider using platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Make sure to update the WebSocket URL to the production server's URL in the environment variables.

## Troubleshooting

- **WebSocket Errors:** If the WebSocket connection fails, ensure the WebSocket server is running, and that you're using the correct URL (e.g., `ws://localhost:3000/ws` or `wss://your-server-url` for production).
- **React Development Server Issues:** If you face issues starting the React development server, try clearing the cache:
  ```bash
  npm start -- --reset-cache
  ```
